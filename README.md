## System Description

We have developed a robust, API-first operating system designed specifically for high-volume food service businesses. Unlike standard website templates, this application manages the entire operational lifecycle of a restaurant, from order entry to final delivery.

The system addresses critical operational bottlenecks by digitizing workflows that are typically handled manually or via disjointed software. It includes four integrated modules that communicate in real-time.

### Core Modules

**1. Point of Sale (POS) Terminal**
A touch-optimized interface for cashiers and waitstaff. It features smart product categorization and server-side financial calculations to ensure data integrity and prevent theft or error.

**2. Kitchen Display System (KDS)**
A digital replacement for kitchen printers. This module organizes incoming orders by priority using a time-based status system (New, Attention, Delayed), helping kitchen staff manage peak hours efficiently.

**3. Delivery Logistics App**
A mobile-first web application for delivery drivers. It includes a dark mode interface for battery efficiency and direct integration with mapping services for one-tap navigation to customer addresses.

**4. Management Dashboard**
A central command center for owners. It provides real-time analytics on sales and performance, along with role-based security controls for sensitive actions like voiding orders.
